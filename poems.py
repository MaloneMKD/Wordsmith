    "body": """As the wind blows on a rainy night
Flashes of lightning set the sky alight
The thunder gives the faint of heart a fright
The sounds of raindrops are a calm soul's delight
Wavering trees put up a fight
But they are no match to lightning's might
All it takes is one lightning strike
In the blink of an eye, it's a terrifying sight
Gone are the stars that often shine bright
Showing off their glory from the great heights
This night only lightning shows off its great light
Shows off its bright glory and terrifying might

soothing_hearts = {
    "title": "Soothing Hearts",
    "body": """Violet skies
Blue ripples in disguise
The sun a pale yellow
On mountain lows and mountain highs
Blissful slow melodies from the wind and the tides
Soothing the souls of those who live and those who died
Dancing reeds in peaceful meadows
Soothing the hearts of grieving widows
Distracting the orphan from his many sorrows
Giving him hope of a brighter tomorrow

funeral_blues = {
    'title': "Funeral Blues",
    'body': """Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,
Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,
Silence the pianos and with muffled drum
Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.

Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead
Scribbling on the sky the message 'He is Dead'.
Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,
Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.

He was my North, my South, my East and West,
My working week and my Sunday rest,
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;
I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.

He was my North, my South, my East and West,
My working week and my Sunday rest,
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;
I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.

He was my North, my South, my East and West,
My working week and my Sunday rest,
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;
I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.

The stars are not wanted now; put out every one,
Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun,
Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood;
For nothing now can ever come to any good.
